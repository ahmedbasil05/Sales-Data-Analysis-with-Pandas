# Sales Data Analysis with Pandas

This project demonstrates a real-world sales data analysis workflow using **Pandas**. It covers essential data manipulation and analysis techniques including data cleaning, feature engineering, filtering, grouping, aggregation, sorting, ranking, pivot tables, and exporting the cleaned dataset.

## Project Overview

The goal is to analyze a sales dataset to extract meaningful insights such as total sales by product/category/month, top customers, and sales trends over time.

---

## What I Did

- Loaded and explored the sales data (`.csv`) with `pandas.read_csv()`
- Performed data cleaning: handled missing values, converted date columns, and dropped invalid rows
- Created new features like `TotalValue`, `Month`, and `Year` for deeper analysis
- Filtered data by conditions (e.g., orders above $500, Electronics in 2024)
- Grouped and aggregated data to summarize sales and quantities
- Sorted and ranked products and customers based on revenue and spending
- Used pivot tables and cross-tabulations to visualize sales distributions
- Exported the processed, clean data to a new CSV file
